        <div class="subheading mb-5">Cymbal Tech</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is Katherine Pham and I am 19 years old. I am currently a second year Psychology major at the University of California, Riverside. When I am not pursuing academics, I participate in music and the performing arts. I am an aspiring young musician that competes in the marching arts. I have been in the activity since primary school. My musical education includes primary school, secondary school, Garden Grove High School, Synergy Percussion, the UC Riverside Symphonic Band, the UC Riverside Pep Band, RCC Fall Marching Band, and Meraki Percussion. <br><br>

        From 2013-2018, I participated in my high school’s instrumental and performing arts program such as chamber orchestra, marching band, symphonic band, the drum majors program, the winterguard program, and the indoor drumline percussion program. I played violin for approximately 6 years and partook in the Garden Grove High School Chamber Orchestra in my last year of violin. For 4 years, I played marching bass drum (Top Bass and Bass Drum #2) for the high school marching band as well as the indoor drumline percussion ensemble. In 2014, I was a part of the winterguard program and performed with marching flags and colorguard. I was a part of the symphonic band throughout my high school career at Garden Grove High School with my primary instrument as percussion and my secondary instrument as French Horn in 2017. In my final year of high school of 2018, I became the drum major for my high school in which I took up a leadership position and led the school marching band. <br><br>

        From 2017-2018, I participated in an independent marching percussion group called Synergy Percussion. The program consists of all marching percussion instruments such as drums and cymbals. For both years at Synergy Percussion, I played marching bass drum (Top Bass). The organization annually participated in charity events at the Angel Stadium such as Light the Night and We Give Thanks for the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society.<br><br>
        
        As of 2018 to present day, I am part of the University of California, Riverside Symphonic Band as well as the UC Riverside Pep Band. In concert percussion, I primarily play percussion instruments such as snare drum, concert bass drum, and mallet instruments. In the UC Riverside Pep Band, my main percussion is marching bass drum and my secondary instruments are marching cymbals and marching snare drum. Performances by University of California, Riverside are traditionally for school events.<br><br>
        
        Since 2019, I have been a part of the RCC Fall Marching Tigers as a marching cymbal player. I have been in the program for 6 months and plan to continue my marching career with the RCC Fall Marching Band until I age out in 2023. RCC Fall is known as the “Hollywood Band” and is traditionally involved in high school exhibition shows, Hollywood movies, television series, or music videos.<br><br>
        
        Currently, I am part of the indoor drumline percussion group called Meraki Percussion. I am one of the five cymbal players in the line and have been playing cymbals for 6 months. I plan to continue playing cymbals until I age out in 2022. Meraki Percussion is an independent open class indoor drumline that performs competitively in the Southern California Percussion Alliance and the Winter Guard International circuits.
